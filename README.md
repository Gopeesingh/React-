Virtuale DOM :-

Example of Virtual DOM in Action:
Let's take an example where we have a React component that displays a counter and increments it when a button is clicked.

jsx

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
Steps of Virtual DOM Process in this Example:
Initial Render: When the Counter component is first rendered, React creates a Virtual DOM tree representing the h1 and button elements.
State Change: When you click the "Increment" button, the count state changes, and React generates a new Virtual DOM tree where the h1 element now shows the updated count.
Diffing: React compares the old Virtual DOM (with the previous count value) to the new Virtual DOM (with the incremented count value). It sees that only the text inside the h1 tag has changed.
Real DOM Update: React then updates just the text inside the h1 element in the actual DOM, leaving the rest of the DOM (the button element, for example) untouched.
This selective updating process makes the app faster and more efficient, especially in complex applications where manipulating the real DOM directly could be slow.

in my word virtual dom is: aap pure ke pure dom ko trake kar sakte ho trace ker sakte ho tree like structure me jo jo value change hue hai sirf usko dom se nikal kar vapis use laga do
